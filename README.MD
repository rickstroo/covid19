This is an open source project for the development of a prototype to assist
in the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients.

It was developed on Mac OS Catalina.
It was run using Python 3.8.  This is not the version of Python that comes with
the Mac OS.  It was downloaded it from python.org.
It depends on a few Python libraries that can be installed using pip.  Those
details are included in the source code.

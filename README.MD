This is an open source project for the management of HL7 records.

It was developed on Mac OS Catalina.
It was run using Python 3.8.  This is not the version of Python that comes with
the Mac OS.  I downloaded it from python.org.
It depends on the hl7 0.3.4 library which I downloaded from pypi.org using the
version of PIP that came with Python 3.8.
It also depends on the pydicom library which I downloaded from pypi.org.
